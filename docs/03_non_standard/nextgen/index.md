# Nextgen

Nextgen is a loosely associated international network of [moulactivists](../../01_standard/moules.md)
with a decentralized command structure that operates on ideas rather than directives.

Nextgen main goals are to reinvent the wheel, break standards and outperform
old [tribunes](../../01_standard/tribune.md) with disruptive innovations.

_Let's make tribune great again!_
